Jeopardy For Teachers
Our team has created a teaching tool for instructors at any level who want to bring a fun game designed to aid in student’s learning. Inspired by Jeopardy, Jeopardy For Teachers allows the user to create a board specific to their needs. The user is able to search our database of over 300,000 Jeopardy questions as well as create their own.
